## Key Behavioral Rules

### Manual Actions (Button Clicks)
1. **Always interrupt current playback** for next/prev buttons
2. **Manual actions override auto-advance logic**
3. **Index changes are immediate** when user clicks next/prev
4. **State transitions are atomic** (no race conditions)

### Auto-Advance (Track Ends Naturally)
1. **Only triggers if not a manual action**
2. **Respects play mode settings**:
   - NORMAL/SHUFFLE: advance to next
   - REPEATONE: repeat current
   - ONCE: stop playback
3. **No auto-advance during TRANSITIONING state**

### State Locks
1. **TRANSITIONING state prevents concurrent operations**
2. **Operations queue if lock is held**
3. **Atomic operations ensure consistency**

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Empty playlist**: All operations return safely
2. **Single track**: Prev/next wrap around correctly
3. **Mode changes**: Shuffle regenerates indices
4. **Rapid button clicks**: Queued and processed sequentially
5. **Player destruction**: All pending operations cancelled

## Implementation Benefits

1. **No Race Conditions**: Atomic operations with locking
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Clear state transitions
3. **Consistent Index Management**: Centralized in state machine
4. **Clean Event Handling**: Separation of manual vs auto actions
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures
